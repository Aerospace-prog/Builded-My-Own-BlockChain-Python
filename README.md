# Simple Blockchain System In (Python)

This project demonstrates the fundamentals of blockchain architecture by implementing a simple blockchain in Python from scratch — no frameworks, just logic.

## 🚀 Features

- 🧱 **Custom Blockchain** with block structure, hashes, and chaining logic.
- ⛏️ **Proof-of-Work** algorithm to simulate mining difficulty and validation.
- 🔒 **Transaction System** with support for sender, receiver, and balances.
- 🧠 **Smart State Logic** that maintains user balances and prevents double-spending.
- 📏 **Chain Validation** and block integrity check on each new addition.
- 📜 **Simple CLI Interface** to simulate block creation and network behavior.

## How to Run
```bash
python3 blockchain.py
```

🛠️ Tech Stack
- Language: Python 3
- Hashing: SHA-256 (hashlib)
- Logic: Pure OOP and Functional Design

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

- Blockchain fundamentals
- Hashing with SHA-256
- Proof-of-Work difficulty
- Merkle chain and block linking
- Transaction verification
- Final state & ledger maintenance

## Sample Output
New Block Received; Checking...
Block accepted. Chain length: 8
Final State: {'Alice': 76, 'Bob': 24}
